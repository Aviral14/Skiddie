You, the Rick from dimension C-137 are suspicious that you will be banned from the citadel of Ricks for your growing anti-Rick activities in the next meeting of the Council of Ricks. Hence you concoct a plan to delete all your criminal records from the supercomputer in the citadel. But, the computer is so secure that it asks you to wait for 10000000 seconds before you can use it. You don't have so much time before your prosecution starts. So can you, 'The Rickest Rick' hack it to to fulfill your evil deeds?
